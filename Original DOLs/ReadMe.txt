For any game or DOL that you'd like to work with, you should place a vanilla (original) copy of the
DOL file in this folder. These original DOLs are used by the program to reference original game code, 
and are required for various functionality, such as region restoration (such as for some mod uninstallations), 
calculating RAM to DOL offsets across differing game revisions, and pulling original code when creating
new mods.


Files should follow this naming convention: "[region] [version].dol"

E.g. "NTSC 1.02.dol"
